The name of our team is **"Daegon"** and it consists of six people:

- Ventsislav Georgiev (ventsislav.georgiev)
- Martin Georgiev (martingeorgiev)
- Katalina Dimitrova (lina94)
- Radi Shikerov (archangelmichael)
- Tancho Mihov (tancho.mihov)
- Ivan Tochev (ivan.tochev.18)

Our project is an **independent library** which can be loaded on a given website. Its purpose is to make the web page fun and dynamic as it adds **fireworks** to its **background** . The user can change the appearance and the effects of the fireworks. Besides the default settings, the user can choose from the **preset effects** :

- **Super Sonic**, which fires the firework with great speed, producing a bright explosion which disappears quickly in the background
- **Rain Effect**, which makes the particles fall down right after the firework explodes, looking like a rain of shining rays
- **Inversed Gravity**, which makes the particles go on the opposite direction – up
- **Rocket Launcher**, which makes the firework explode slowly, making more and bigger, spectacular particles 
- **New Year**, which produces a great number of fireworks exploding in the same time, making the user re-experience the excitement of the New Year's Eve
- **Distortion**, which makes the particles take different directions after explosion and disappear right after that
- **Exploding Star**, which makes the particles take different directions and disappear after they have been on screen for some time
- **Circle Path**, which is a firework making a fine circle after its explosion
- **Super Nova**, which makes a dazzling explosion with huge particles taking a great part of the screen
- Or **Custom**, where the user can change the default settings and make his own impressive firework.

Once he has chosen the fireworks he likes best, the user can press the " **Generate Script** " button and get the script he can use on his website. If he wants to see how they would look on a given page, he can write the url of his page in the input box and the page will automatically be loaded with fireworks as a **demo** .

As we all know, the fireworks are mostly used when people celebrate a certain event. To express their feelings, they can use the " **Greeting** " functionality and can add a custom text to greet someone. The text appears on the foreground of the webpage. After a certain time, the text disappears, making place for new fireworks.

As we mentioned earlier, the user can make custom changes to the preset default styles of the fireworks. The things he can customize are:

- **Line** – the user can change the width of the line and can remove its shadow
- **Timings** – the user can change the time before the new fireworks appear on screen
- **Firework** – the length of the trail can be customized as well as the speed and the acceleration with which the firework is fired. The user decides if he wants the target to be shown and the radius with which it is marked.
- **Particle** – the length and the number of the trails can be easily changed. The user can experiment with the slowdown, he can change the direction which the particles take after explosion and he can make them more or less transparent.
